** v0.0.2
*** Breaking changes
**** Completion backends
org-z now supports both Helm and Selectrum for completion. The completion backend must be explicitly set by loading one of ~org-z-helm~ or ~org-z-selectrum~ (which each depend on a respective completion framework) in addition to ~org-z~. Working configuration looks like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-z
    :straight (org-z :type git :host github :repo "landakram/org-z")
    :config
    (org-z-mode 1))

  (use-package org-z-selectrum
    :straight (org-z :type git :host github :repo "landakram/org-z"))
#+end_src
*** Other changes
**** Sort links with prescient.el
Results can be optionally sorted with [[https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el][prescient.el]] by setting ~org-z-use-prescient~. Note that if you already have prescient enabled through your completion system, you should leave this as nil.
