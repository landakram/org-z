Lightweight, Org-mode flavored zettelkasten links.
#+end_quote

org-z is an Emacs global minor mode that enables a lightweight, Org mode style zettelkasten. Unlike a traditional zettelkasten, org-z focuses on headings rather than pages, allowing you to make hyperlinks within a single Org mode document.

By treating headings, rather than pages, as first-class, we can use standard functions that ship with org like [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html][org-store-link]] and packages like [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar][org-sidebar]] to maximum effect.

org-z has the following features:

 - Insert links to org headings with interactive search (~C-c-.~ by default). [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] are supported.
 - Links are managed automatically using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html][org-store-link]] and org-ids
 - Links to new / missing targets auto-create targets in a configurable file location (~new.org~ by default). Creation of the new heading is customizable using a capture template.

** Installation

Install with straight.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-z
    :straight (org-z :type git :host github :repo "landakram/org-z")
    :config
    (org-z-mode 1))
#+end_src

org-z requires a completion backend. [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] are currently supported. You'll need to load one of the completion backend packages, in addition to org-z itself:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-z-selectrum
    :straight (org-z-selectrum :type git :host github :repo "landakram/org-z"))
#+end_src

Loading the package sets the completion backend by appending to ~org-z-completion-backends~ and setting ~org-z-completion-backend~.

** A lightweight zettelkasten

I combine org-z with a daily journal, implemented as a ~file+datetree~ capture template, and [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar][org-sidebar]] backlinks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(;; ...
          ("j" "Journal entry" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
           "* %?\n" :unnarrowed t)))

  (use-package org-sidebar
    :ensure t
    :after (general)
    :config
    (leader-def :infix "o"
      "b" 'org-sidebar-backlinks))
#+end_src

As I go about my day, I make journal entries that link to various headings in my collection of org files. I make these links by invoking ~org-z-insert-link~ as I write my journal entry. I periodically open the backlinks sidebar to investigate connections.

Every once in a while, I review my journal entries and ~org-refile~ headings or simply re-organize journal entry knowledge into "longer-term storage" (~reference.org~ or ~projects.org~).

** Motivation

I was inspired by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]], but wanted something that fit my existing org workflow, which is a handful of files with deep headings rather than a file per topic.
